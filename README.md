Business Case:

Problem: The traditional ticketing industry faces issues of fraud, counterfeiting, and lack of transparency. Real estate investment often requires substantial capital, limiting accessibility for many individuals.

Target Market: Our solution is aimed at event organizers and real estate investors, as well as the general public looking for secure and accessible ticketing and real estate investment options.

Solution: Our blockchain app combines ticket purchasing and fractionalized real estate investment. For ticketing, it offers transparent, secure, and fraud-resistant ticket transactions. For real estate, it enables individuals to invest in property with smaller amounts of capital. It simplifies the process of participating in these markets, making it more inclusive and secure.

Market Landscape: Traditional ticketing systems and real estate investments rely on centralized models that lack transparency and accessibility. While blockchain is making inroads in both sectors, our solution uniquely combines these two markets, leveraging the advantages of blockchain to provide a seamless, secure, and inclusive experience. This innovative approach positions us to disrupt the existing landscape by addressing key pain points in both industries while opening up new opportunities for investment and access.
